   * distance, or anything else. Distances should be compared only between
   * tablets of the same group; they are not meaningful between different
   * groups.

   * the client, and have minimum network latency. A value less than or equal to
   * five indicates that the tablet is thought to be in the same region as the
   * client, and may have a few milliseconds of network latency. Values greater
   * than five are most likely in a different region, with non-trivial network
   * latency.
   *
   * Clients should use the following algorithm:
   * * If the request is using a directed read, eliminate any tablets that
   * do not match the directed read's target zone and/or replica type.
   * * (Read-write transactions only) Choose leader tablet if it has an
   * distance &lt;=5.
   * * Group and sort tablets by distance. Choose a random
   * tablet with the lowest distance. If the request
   * is not a directed read, only consider replicas with distances &lt;=5.
   * * Send the request to the fallback endpoint.
   *
   * The tablet picked by this algorithm may be skipped, either because it is
   * marked as `skip` by the server or because the corresponding server is
   * unreachable, flow controlled, etc. Skipped tablets should be added to the
   * `skipped_tablet_uid` field in `RoutingHint`; the algorithm above should
   * then be re-run without including the skipped tablet(s) to pick the next
   * best tablet.
