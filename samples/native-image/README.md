# Spanner Sample Application with Native Image

This is a sample application which uses the Cloud Spanner client libraries and demonstrates compatibility with Native Image compilation.

The application creates a new Spanner instance and database, and it runs basic operations including queries and Spanner mutations.

## Setup Instructions

You will need to follow these prerequisite steps in order to run these samples:

1. If you have not already, [create a Google Cloud Platform Project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).

2. Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) which will allow you to run the sample with your project's credentials.

   Once installed, log in with Application Default Credentials using the following command:

    ```
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

   **Note:** Authenticating with Application Default Credentials is convenient to use during development, but we recommend [alternate methods of authentication](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production) during production use.

3. Install the GraalVM compiler.

   You can follow the [official installation instructions](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started-with-graalvm/#install-graalvm) from the GraalVM website.
   After following the instructions, ensure that you install the Native Image extension installed by running:

    ```
    gu install native-image
    ```

   Once you finish following the instructions, verify that the default version of Java is set to the GraalVM version by running `java -version` in a terminal.

   You will see something similar to the below output:

    ```
    $ java -version
   
   openjdk version "11.0.15" 2022-04-19
   OpenJDK Runtime Environment GraalVM CE 22.1.0 (build 11.0.15+10-jvmci-22.1-b06)
   OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM GraalVM CE 22.1.0 (build 11.0.15+10-jvmci-22.1-b06, mixed mode, sharing)

    ```
## Run with Native Image Compilation

1. **(Optional)** If you wish to run the application against the [Spanner emulator](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/emulator), make sure that you have the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) installed.

   In a new terminal window, start the emulator via `gcloud`:

    ```
    gcloud beta emulators spanner start
    ```

   You may leave the emulator running for now.
   In the next section, we will run the sample application against the Spanner emulator instsance.

2. Navigate to this directory and compile the application with the Native Image compiler.

    ```
    mvn package -P native -DskipTests
    ```

3. **(Optional)** If you're using the emulator, export the `SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST` as an environment variable in your terminal.

    ```
    export SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9010
    ``` 

   The Spanner Client Libraries will detect this environment variable and will automatically connect to the emulator instance if this variable is set.

4. Run the application.

    ```
    ./target/native-image
    ```

5. The application will run through some basic Spanner operations and log some output statements.

    ```

## Sample Integration test with Native Image Support

In order to run the sample integration test as a native image, call the following command:

   ```
   mvn test -Pnative
   ```
