/**
 * Defines how Cloud Spanner will choose a timestamp for a read-only transaction or a single
 * read/query.
 *
 * <p>The types of timestamp bound are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Strong (the default).
 *   <li>Bounded staleness.
 *   <li>Exact staleness.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed, stale read-only
 * transactions can execute more quickly than strong or read-write transactions, because they are
 * able to execute far from the leader replica.
 *
 * <p>Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
 *
 * <h2>Strong reads</h2>
 *
 * <p>Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions that have committed before
 * the start of the read. Furthermore, all rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each
 * other - if any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
 * transaction.
 *
 * <p>Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only transactions might return
 * inconsistent results if there are concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
 * reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read timestamp.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link #strong()} to create a bound of this type.
 *
 * <h2>Exact Staleness</h2>
 *
 * <p>These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are
 * guaranteed to see a consistent prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
 * modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp less than or equal to the read
 * timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by transactions with a larger commit
 * timestamp. They will block until all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit
 * timestamps less than or equal to the read timestamp have finished.
 *
 * <p>The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit timestamp or a
 * staleness relative to the current time.
 *
 * <p>These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a timestamp. As a result, they
 * execute slightly faster than the equivalent bounded stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
 * boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link #ofReadTimestamp(Timestamp)} and {@link #ofExactStaleness(long, TimeUnit)} to
 * create a bound of this type.
 *
 * <h2>Bounded Staleness</h2>
 *
 * <p>Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp, subject to a
 * user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the newest timestamp within the staleness
 * bound that allows execution of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
 *
 * <p>All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of the read observes a
 * transaction, all parts of the read see the transaction. Bounded stale reads are not repeatable:
 * two stale reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at different timestamps
 * and thus return inconsistent results.
 *
 * <p>Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase negotiates a timestamp among all
 * replicas needed to serve the read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
 * timestamp.
 *
 * <p>As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are usually a little slower
 * than comparable exact staleness reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
 * results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
 *
 * <p>Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of which rows will be read, it
 * can only be used with single-use reads and single-use read-only transactions.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link #ofMinReadTimestamp(Timestamp)} and {@link #ofMaxStaleness(long, TimeUnit)} to
 * create a bound of this type.
 *
 * <h2>Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection</h2>
 *
 * <p>Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data in the background to
 * reclaim storage space. This process is known as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims
 * versions after they are four hours old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads at
 * read timestamps more than four hours in the past. This restriction also applies to in-progress
 * reads and/or SQL queries whose timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries
 * with too-old read timestamps fail with the error {@link ErrorCode#FAILED_PRECONDITION}.
 *
 * @see Session#singleUse(TimestampBound)
 * @see Session#singleUseReadOnlyTransaction(TimestampBound)
 * @see Session#readOnlyTransaction(TimestampBound)
