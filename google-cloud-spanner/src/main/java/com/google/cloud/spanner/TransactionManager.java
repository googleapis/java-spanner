/**
 * An interface for managing the life cycle of a read write transaction including all its retries.
 * See {@link TransactionContext} for a description of transaction semantics.
 *
 * <p>At any point in time there can be at most one active transaction in this manager. When that
 * transaction is committed, if it fails with an {@code ABORTED} error, calling {@link
 * #resetForRetry()} would create a new {@link TransactionContext}. The newly created transaction
 * would use the same session thus increasing its lock priority. If the transaction is committed
 * successfully, or is rolled back or commit fails with any error other than {@code ABORTED}, the
 * manager is considered complete and no further transactions are allowed to be created in it.
 *
 * <p>Every {@code TransactionManager} should either be committed or rolled back. Failure to do so
 * can cause resources to be leaked and deadlocks. Easiest way to guarantee this is by calling
 * {@link #close()} in a finally block.
 *
