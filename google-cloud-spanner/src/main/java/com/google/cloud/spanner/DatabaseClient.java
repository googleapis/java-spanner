   * Returns the lower bound of rows modified by this DML statement.
   *
   * <p>The method will block until the update is complete. Running a DML statement with this method
   * does not offer exactly once semantics, and therfore the DML statement should be idempotent. The
   * DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement must be expressible as
   * the union of many statements which each access only a single row of the table. This is a
   * Partitioned DML transaction in which a single Partitioned DML statement is executed.
   * Partitioned DML partitions the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition in
   * parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit independently. Partitioned DML
   * transactions do not need to be committed.
   *
   * <p>Partitioned DML updates are used to execute a single DML statement with a different
   * execution strategy that provides different, and often better, scalability properties for large,
   * table-wide operations than DML in a {@link #readWriteTransaction()} transaction. Smaller scoped
   * statements, such as an OLTP workload, should prefer using {@link
   * TransactionContext#executeUpdate(Statement)} with {@link #readWriteTransaction()}.
   *
   * <p>That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used in {@link
   * #readWriteTransaction()}.
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement must be
   *       expressible as the union of many statements which each access only a single row of the
   *       table.
   *   <li>The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather, the statement
   *       is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in independent internal transactions.
   *       Secondary index rows are updated atomically with the base table rows.
   *   <li>Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics against a partition.
   *       The statement will be applied at least once to each partition. It is strongly recommended
   *       that the DML statement should be idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it
   *       is potentially dangerous to run a statement such as `UPDATE table SET column = column +
   *       1` as it could be run multiple times against some rows.
   *   <li>The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for Commit or Rollback.
   *       If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing the DML statement dies, it is
   *       possible that some rows had the statement executed on them successfully. It is also
   *       possible that statement was never executed against other rows.
   *   <li>If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML operation (for
   *       instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a value that cannot be stored
   *       due to schema constraints), then the operation is stopped at that point and an error is
   *       returned. It is possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
   *       committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide, operations that are
   * idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large table.
