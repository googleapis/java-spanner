/**
 * An interface for managing the life cycle of a read write transaction including all its retries.
 * See {@link TransactionContext} for a description of transaction semantics.
 *
 * <p>At any point in time there can be at most one active transaction in this manager. When that
 * transaction is committed, if it fails with an {@code ABORTED} error, calling {@link
 * #resetForRetryAsync()} would create a new {@link TransactionContextFuture}. The newly created
 * transaction would use the same session thus increasing its lock priority. If the transaction is
 * committed successfully, or is rolled back or commit fails with any error other than {@code
 * ABORTED}, the manager is considered complete and no further transactions are allowed to be
 * created in it.
 *
 * <p>Every {@code AsyncTransactionManager} should either be committed or rolled back. Failure to do
 * so can cause resources to be leaked and deadlocks. Easiest way to guarantee this is by calling
 * {@link #close()} in a finally block.
 *
 * @see DatabaseClient#transactionManagerAsync()
