 * Provides access to the data returned by a Cloud Spanner read or query. {@code ResultSet} allows a
 * single row to be inspected at a time through the methods from the {@link StructReader} interface,
 * in the order that the rows were returned by the read or query. The result set can be positioned
 * over the next row, if one exists, by calling {@link #next()}; this method returns {@code false}
 * when all rows returned have been seen. The result set is initially positioned before the first
 * row, so a call to {@code next()} is required before the first row can be inspected.
 *
 * <p>{@code ResultSet} implementations may buffer data ahead and/or maintain a persistent streaming
 * connection to the remote service until all data has been returned or the resultSet closed. As
 * such, it is important that all uses of {@code ResultSet} either fully consume it (that is, call
 * {@code next()} until {@code false} is returned or it throws an exception) or explicitly call
 * {@link #close()}: failure to do so may result in wasted work or leaked resources.
 *
 * <p>{@code ResultSet} implementations are not required to be thread-safe: if methods are called
 * from multiple threads, external synchronization must be used.
