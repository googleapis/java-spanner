/**
 * A client to Cloud Spanner Instance Admin API.
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>=================== InstanceAdminClient ===================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Cloud Spanner Instance Admin API
 *
 * <p>The Cloud Spanner Instance Admin API can be used to create, delete, modify and list instances.
 * Instances are dedicated Cloud Spanner serving and storage resources to be used by Cloud Spanner
 * databases.
 *
 * <p>Each instance has a "configuration", which dictates where the serving resources for the Cloud
 * Spanner instance are located (e.g., US-central, Europe). Configurations are created by Google
 * based on resource availability.
 *
 * <p>Cloud Spanner billing is based on the instances that exist and their sizes. After an instance
 * exists, there are no additional per-database or per-operation charges for use of the instance
 * (though there may be additional network bandwidth charges). Instances offer isolation: problems
 * with databases in one instance will not affect other instances. However, within an instance
 * databases can affect each other. For example, if one database in an instance receives a lot of
 * requests and consumes most of the instance resources, fewer resources are available for other
 * databases in that instance, and their performance may suffer.
 *
 * <p>Sample for InstanceAdminClient:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * try (InstanceAdminClient instanceAdminClient = InstanceAdminClient.create()) {
 *   InstanceConfigName name = InstanceConfigName.of("[PROJECT]", "[INSTANCE_CONFIG]");
 *   InstanceConfig response = instanceAdminClient.getInstanceConfig(name);
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
