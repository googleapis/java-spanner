  /**
   * Register a callback with the ResultSet to be made aware when more data is available, changing
   * the usage pattern from sync to async. Details:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>The callback will be called at least once.
   *   <li>The callback is run each time more results are available, or when we discover that there
   *       will be no more results. (unless paused, see below). Spurious callbacks are possible, see
   *       below.
   *   <li>Spanner guarantees that one callback is ever outstanding at a time. Also, future
   *       callbacks guarantee the "happens before" property with previous callbacks.
   *   <li>A callback normally consumes all available data in the ResultSet, and then returns {@link
   *       CallbackResponse#CONTINUE}.
   *   <li>If a callback returns {@link CallbackResponse#CONTINUE} with data still in the ResultSet,
   *       the callback is invoked again immediately!
   *   <li>Once a callback has returned {@link CallbackResponse#PAUSE} on the cursor no more
   *       callbacks will be run until a corresponding {@link #resume()}.
   *   <li>Callback will stop being called once any of the following occurs:
   *       <ol>
   *         <li>Callback returns {@link CallbackResponse#DONE}.
   *         <li>{@link ResultSet#tryNext()} returns {@link CursorState#DONE}.
   *         <li>{@link ResultSet#tryNext()} throws an exception.
   *       </ol>
   *   <li>Callback may possibly be invoked after a call to {@link ResultSet#cancel()} call, but the
   *       subsequent call to {@link #tryNext()} will yield a SpannerException.
   *   <li>Spurious callbacks are possible where cursors are not actually ready. Typically callback
   *       should return {@link CallbackResponse#CONTINUE} any time it sees {@link
   *       CursorState#NOT_READY}.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <h3>Flow Control</h3>
   *
   * If no flow control is needed (say because result sizes are known in advance to be finite in
   * size) then async processing is simple. The following is a code example that transfers work from
   * the cursor to an upstream sink:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * @Override
   * public CallbackResponse cursorReady(ResultSet cursor) {
   *   try {
   *     while (true) {
   *       switch (cursor.tryNext()) {
   *         case OK:    upstream.emit(cursor.getRow()); break;
   *         case DONE:  upstream.done(); return CallbackResponse.DONE;
   *         case NOT_READY:  return CallbackResponse.CONTINUE;
   *       }
   *     }
   *   } catch (SpannerException e) {
   *     upstream.doneWithError(e);
   *     return CallbackResponse.DONE;
   *   }
   * }
   * }</pre>
   *
   * Flow control may be needed if for example the upstream system may not always be ready to handle
   * more data. In this case the app developer has two main options:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Semi-async: make {@code upstream.emit()} a blocking call. This will block the callback
   *       thread until progress is possible. When coding in this way the threads in the Executor
   *       provided to {@link #setCallback(Executor, ReadyCallback)} must be blockable without
   *       causing harm to progress in your system.
   *   <li>Full-async: call {@code cursor.pause()} and return from the callback with data still in
   *       the Cursor. Once in this state cursor waits until resume() is called before calling
   *       callback again.
   * </ul>
   *
   * @param exec executor on which to run all callbacks. Typically use a threadpool. If the executor
   *     is one that runs the work on the submitting thread, you must be very careful not to throw
   *     RuntimeException up the stack, lest you do damage to calling components. For example, it
   *     may cause an event dispatcher thread to crash.
   * @param cb ready callback
   * @return An {@link ApiFuture} that returns <code>null</code> when the consumption of the {@link
   *     AsyncResultSet} has finished successfully. No more calls to the {@link ReadyCallback} will
   *     follow and all resources used by the {@link AsyncResultSet} have been cleaned up. The
   *     {@link ApiFuture} throws an {@link ExecutionException} if the consumption of the {@link
   *     AsyncResultSet} finished with an error.
