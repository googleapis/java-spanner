// AUTO-GENERATED DOCUMENTATION AND CLASS.
/**
 * Service Description: Service that executes SpannerActions asynchronously.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (SpannerExecutorProxyClient spannerExecutorProxyClient =
 *     SpannerExecutorProxyClient.create()) {
 *   BidiStream<SpannerAsyncActionRequest, SpannerAsyncActionResponse> bidiStream =
 *       spannerExecutorProxyClient.executeActionAsyncCallable().call();
 *   SpannerAsyncActionRequest request =
 *       SpannerAsyncActionRequest.newBuilder()
 *           .setActionId(198295492)
 *           .setAction(SpannerAction.newBuilder().build())
 *           .build();
 *   bidiStream.send(request);
 *   for (SpannerAsyncActionResponse response : bidiStream) {
 *     // Do something when a response is received.
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the SpannerExecutorProxyClient object to clean up
 * resources such as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically
 * calls close().
 *
 * <table>
 *    <caption>Methods</caption>
 *    <tr>
 *      <th>Method</th>
 *      <th>Description</th>
 *      <th>Method Variants</th>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *      <td><p> ExecuteActionAsync</td>
 *      <td><p> ExecuteActionAsync is a streaming call that starts executing a new Spanner action.
 * <p>  For each request, the server will reply with one or more responses, but only the last response will contain status in the outcome.
 * <p>  Responses can be matched to requests by action_id. It is allowed to have multiple actions in flight--in that case, actions are be executed in parallel.</td>
 *      <td>
 *      <p>Callable method variants take no parameters and return an immutable API callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *           <li><p> executeActionAsyncCallable()
 *      </ul>
 *       </td>
 *    </tr>
 *  </table>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of SpannerExecutorProxySettings
 * to create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * SpannerExecutorProxySettings spannerExecutorProxySettings =
 *     SpannerExecutorProxySettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * SpannerExecutorProxyClient spannerExecutorProxyClient =
 *     SpannerExecutorProxyClient.create(spannerExecutorProxySettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * SpannerExecutorProxySettings spannerExecutorProxySettings =
 *     SpannerExecutorProxySettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * SpannerExecutorProxyClient spannerExecutorProxyClient =
 *     SpannerExecutorProxyClient.create(spannerExecutorProxySettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
